Git is a popular version control system used by software and Web developers, among many other professions. It helps track changes in a project and can be useful for melding together the features of various versions of a project.

GitHub is an online provider of hosting for software development that offers the functionality and features of Git along with its own specialized features for version control.

WebStorm is an IDE with built-in Git compatibility. This means that once code is ready to be pushed, Webstorm has built in functions that allow a user to do so without using terminal arguments.

### How to Use Github:
Step 1) Write code until you have a version that you want saved and documented.

Step 2) Make sure you are on the correct branch on Git. If you have no branch, create one. If you are on the wrong one, switch to the right one or create a new one branching off         the original.

Step 3) Add the files that you want saved as part of that version to Git. Git will begin tracking changes in those files once you have done so. This step does not need to be             repeated in a cycle after the first time you've added the files you want

Step 4) Commit the files with a **detailed/relevant** commit message. The message is a crucial detail so that you will understand what this version is for in the future when you look back at past commits.

Step 5) Push the files to Git.

Step 6) Go to GitHub. Navigate tio the repository that you pushed to and create a new pull request from that push. Merge and committ to the brancg.

Step 7) Pull the remote version back to your machine to sync changes.

Congratulations! You have used Git version control successfully.

### Glossary

**Branch**: Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository
**Clone**: The git clone command is used to create a copy of a specific repository or branch within a repository.
**Commit**: git commit creates a commit, which is like a snapshot of your repository. These commits are snapshots of your entire repository at specific times.
**Fetch**: Fetching changes from a remote repository. Use git fetch to retrieve new work done by other people.
**GIT**: Version control system.
**Github**:  provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git
**Merge**: Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.
**Merge Conflict**: Merge conflicts happen when you merge branches that have competing commits, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final version.
**Push**: git push updates the remote branch with local commits. It is one of the four commands in Git that prompts interaction with the remote repository.
**Pull**: git pull is one of the 4 remote operations within Git. Without running git pull , your local repository will never be updated with changes from the remote.
**Remote**: A remote in Git is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes.
**Repository**: A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history.
